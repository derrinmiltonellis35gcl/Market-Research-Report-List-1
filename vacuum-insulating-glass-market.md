<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Insulating Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempered VIG</li><li>Non-tempered VIG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) market includes two main types: tempered VIG and non-tempered VIG. Tempered VIGs are made by heating and cooling the glass rapidly to increase its strength and durability, making them suitable for applications that require high mechanical strength. On the other hand, non-tempered VIGs are not subjected to the same heat treatment, making them more cost-effective but less durable. Both types offer exceptional thermal insulation properties, making them popular choices for energy-efficient building designs.</p></p>
