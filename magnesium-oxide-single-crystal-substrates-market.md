<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Oxide Single Crystal Substrates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Polishing</li><li>Both Side Polishing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnesium oxide single crystal substrates are available in two different types based on the polishing method used. Single side polishing involves polishing only one side of the substrate, leaving the other side rough. This type of substrate is commonly used when only one side needs to be in contact with other materials. On the other hand, both side polishing involves polishing both sides of the substrate, resulting in a smooth finish on both sides. This type is used when both sides need to be in contact with other materials or during flip-chip bonding processes.</p></p>
