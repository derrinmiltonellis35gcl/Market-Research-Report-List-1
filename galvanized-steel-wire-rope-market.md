<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Wire Rope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro-Galvanizing Steel Wire Rope</li><li>Hot-Dip Galvanized Steel Wire Rope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel wire rope market consists of two main types - Electro-Galvanizing Steel Wire Rope and Hot-Dip Galvanized Steel Wire Rope. Electro-Galvanizing involves coating the steel wire rope with a thin layer of zinc through an electroplating process, providing moderate protection against corrosion. On the other hand, Hot-Dip Galvanizing immerses the steel wire rope in a bath of molten zinc, creating a thicker and more durable coating that offers superior protection against rust and corrosion.</p></p>
