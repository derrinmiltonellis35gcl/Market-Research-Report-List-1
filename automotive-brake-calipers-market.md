<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Brake Calipers</li><li>Fixed Brake Calipers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake calipers market consists of two main types: floating brake calipers and fixed brake calipers. Floating brake calipers are designed to move or float on guide pins, allowing the braking force to be evenly distributed across the brake rotor. They are generally easier to manufacture and maintain. On the other hand, fixed brake calipers are rigidly mounted and do not move during braking. They provide better braking performance and are commonly used in high-performance vehicles. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the vehicle.</p></p>
