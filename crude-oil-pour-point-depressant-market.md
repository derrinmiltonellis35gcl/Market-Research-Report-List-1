<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pour Point Depressant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymeric Depressant</li><li>Surfactant Depressant</li><li>Compound Depressant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crude oil pour point depressants are additives used to lower the temperature at which crude oil thickens and becomes difficult to pump. There are three main types of pour point depressants in the market: polymeric depressants, surfactant depressants, and compound depressants. Polymeric depressants consist of long-chain polymers that interact with wax molecules to prevent agglomeration. Surfactant depressants work by altering the interfacial tension between oil and wax. Compound depressants are a combination of both polymers and surfactants, offering a more comprehensive approach to improving flow properties of crude oil.</p></p>
