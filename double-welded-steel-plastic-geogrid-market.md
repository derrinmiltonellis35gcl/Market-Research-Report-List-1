<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Welded Steel Plastic Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial tension</li><li>Uniaxial tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double Welded Steel Plastic Geogrid is available in two main market types: Biaxial tension and Uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids have equal strength in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, providing optimal reinforcement for applications requiring multidirectional support. Uniaxial tension geogrids, on the other hand, are designed to offer maximum strength in one direction, making them ideal for projects where reinforcement is needed primarily in a single direction. Both types of geogrids offer durable, reliable reinforcement for a variety of construction and civil engineering applications.</p></p>
