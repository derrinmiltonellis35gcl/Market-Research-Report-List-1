<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gauge Pressure Transmitters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Line Gauge Pressure Transmitters</li><li>Remote-Sealed Gauge Pressure Transmitters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gauge pressure transmitters are instruments used to measure the pressure in a system relative to atmospheric pressure. There are two main types: in-line gauge pressure transmitters and remote-sealed gauge pressure transmitters. In-line transmitters are directly installed in the process line and measure the pressure of the fluid or gas. Remote-sealed transmitters, on the other hand, use a diaphragm seal connected to the process line via capillaries, allowing for measurements in situations where it may not be feasible or safe to directly install the transmitter.</p></p>
