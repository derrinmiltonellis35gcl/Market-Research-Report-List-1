<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prostaglandin Analogs</li><li>Beta Blockers</li><li>Alpha Agonists</li><li>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma therapeutics market types refer to various categories of medications used for the treatment of glaucoma, a progressive eye disease. Prostaglandin analogs are drugs that help to reduce intraocular pressure by improving the outflow of fluid from the eye. Beta blockers work by reducing the production of aqueous humor, thus lowering pressure in the eye. Alpha agonists work by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing outflow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease the production of fluid in the eye by blocking an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. These medications are used to manage glaucoma and prevent vision loss.</p></p>
