<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct TPMS involves sensors inside the tires that directly measure the tire pressure and transmit the data to the dashboard. This system offers more accurate real-time information but is more expensive to install. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, uses the vehicle's existing sensors to monitor tire pressure based on factors like wheel speed and inflation rates. While indirect TPMS is more cost-effective, it may not be as accurate as direct TPMS in detecting tire pressure issues.</p></p>
