<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MAG Welding Torches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MIG welding torches come in two main types: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled torches are lightweight and easier to maneuver, making them a popular choice for light-duty applications. However, they can overheat quickly when used for long periods of time. On the other hand, water-cooled torches have a built-in cooling system that circulates water to prevent overheating, allowing them to be used for heavy-duty welding projects. Water-cooled torches are bulkier and require additional equipment for the cooling system.</p></p>
