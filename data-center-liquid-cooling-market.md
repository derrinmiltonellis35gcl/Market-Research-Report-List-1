<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Data Center Liquid Cooling market comprises two main types: Single Phase Cooling and Two Phase Cooling. Single Phase Cooling involves the direct use of liquid (typically water) to cool the electronic components within a data center. It is a simpler and more common approach, with the liquid absorbing the heat generated by the equipment. On the other hand, Two Phase Cooling employs a liquid that vaporizes upon absorbing the heat, carrying it away from the equipment. This method allows for even more efficient cooling but is less commonly used due to its complexity.</p></p>
