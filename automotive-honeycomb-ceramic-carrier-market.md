<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Honeycomb Ceramic Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight-through Carriers</li><li>Wall Flow Carriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Honeycomb Ceramic Carriers are used in catalytic converters for reducing emissions in vehicles. There are two main types of carriers in the market: Straight-through Carriers and Wall Flow Carriers. Straight-through Carriers allow exhaust gases to flow straight through the channels, while Wall Flow Carriers force exhaust gases to pass through porous walls, increasing the contact between the gas and the catalyst. Wall Flow Carriers are more efficient in trapping particulate matter and are commonly used in diesel vehicles for emission control.</p></p>
