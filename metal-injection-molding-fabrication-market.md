<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Injection Molding Fabrication Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Furnace</li><li>Continuous Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Injection Molding (MIM) fabrication market consists of two main types: Batch Furnace and Continuous Furnace. In Batch Furnace, the process involves loading a limited quantity of metal feedstock into a furnace, where it is processed in a batch. The furnace is then emptied, and the next batch is loaded. In Continuous Furnace, a continuous stream of metal feedstock is fed into the furnace, allowing for a constant production flow. This increases efficiency as there is no need for batch loading and unloading. Both types have their advantages and are utilized based on specific requirements.</p></p>
