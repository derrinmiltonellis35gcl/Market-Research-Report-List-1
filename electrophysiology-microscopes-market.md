<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrophysiology Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microscope Movement</li><li>Sample Movement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrophysiology microscopes come in two main types: Microscope Movement and Sample Movement. Microscope Movement refers to the ability of the microscope itself to move and adjust focus or positioning for better visualization of samples. Sample Movement, on the other hand, involves the ability of the sample being observed to move or be manipulated within the microscope for different viewing angles or perspectives. Both types play an important role in providing researchers with accurate and detailed electrophysiological data.</p></p>
