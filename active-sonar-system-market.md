<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Sonar System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Beam Sonar System</li><li>Side Scan Sonar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The active sonar system market encompasses various types, including the multi-beam sonar system and side scan sonar system. Multi-beam sonar systems utilize multiple beams of sound waves to scan wide areas and provide detailed images of the seafloor or underwater objects. On the other hand, side scan sonar systems emit sound waves in a fan-like pattern to create high-resolution images of the seafloor or targets on both sides of the sonar device's path. Both systems play crucial roles in underwater exploration, navigation, and search operations.</p></p>
