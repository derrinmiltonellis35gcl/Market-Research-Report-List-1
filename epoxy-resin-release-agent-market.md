<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Resin Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resin Mold Release Wax</li><li>Resin Mold Release Spray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy resin release agents are critical for the successful removal of resin mold products from their molds. There are two main types in the market: resin mold release wax and resin mold release spray. Resin mold release wax is a semi-solid substance that is applied to the mold surface before resin is poured in, creating a barrier that allows for easy release. Resin mold release spray, on the other hand, is a liquid spray that is applied directly onto the mold surface to achieve the same effect of easy release. Both types are essential for achieving high-quality resin mold products.</p></p>
