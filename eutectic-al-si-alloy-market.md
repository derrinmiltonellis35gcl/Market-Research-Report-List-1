<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eutectic Al-Si Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Eutectic</li><li>Hypereutectic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eutectic Al-Si Alloy market consists of two main types: Single Eutectic and Hypereutectic. Single Eutectic alloys have a composition where the primary silicon phase forms directly from the melt during solidification. These alloys have relatively low silicon content compared to other types. On the other hand, Hypereutectic alloys have a higher silicon content, resulting in the formation of primary silicon crystals along with the eutectic phase during solidification. This difference in composition affects the properties and applications of the alloys in various industries.</p></p>
