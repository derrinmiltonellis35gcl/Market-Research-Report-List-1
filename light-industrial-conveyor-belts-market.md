<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Industrial Conveyor Belts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coating Process</li><li>Calendering Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Light Industrial Conveyor Belts are divided into two types based on the manufacturing process: Coating Process and Calendering Process. The Coating Process involves applying a layer of coating material onto a base fabric, which provides the necessary strength and durability to the belt. In contrast, the Calendering Process involves passing the base fabric through a series of rollers, which compress and smooth the fabric to achieve the desired thickness and texture. Both processes ensure the production of high-quality conveyor belts suitable for light industrial applications.</p></p>
