<p><h1>Balloon-expandable Stents Market Provides Detailed Segmentation of this Market based on Type, Application, and Region and Forecast for the Period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Balloon-expandable Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expandable stents are medical devices used to treat narrowed or blocked arteries by expanding them and improving blood flow. These stents are made of a metal framework and a balloon-like structure that holds the stent in place. The metal framework provides support to the artery walls, while the balloon is inflated to expand the stent and ensure it stays in position.</p><p>The balloon-expandable stents market has witnessed significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 9.2% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, is one of the key factors driving the market growth. Additionally, lifestyle changes, aging population, and rising healthcare expenditures are contributing to the demand for balloon-expandable stents.</p><p>Technological advancements in stent design and materials have also played a crucial role in the market growth. The development of bioresorbable stents, which gradually dissolve in the body over time, is gaining popularity as it eliminates the need for long-term stent placement. Other innovations include drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent the re-narrowing of arteries, and self-expanding stents that adapt to the vessel walls and maintain blood flow.</p><p>Moreover, increased awareness among healthcare professionals and patients about the benefits of balloon-expandable stents in treating coronary artery diseases is likely to drive market growth. The rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures and advancements in healthcare infrastructure in developing economies further contribute to the market expansion.</p><p>In conclusion, the balloon-expandable stents market is witnessing substantial growth due to the increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements, and greater awareness. With ongoing advancements and research in stent technology, the market is expected to experience further growth in the coming years.</p></p>
