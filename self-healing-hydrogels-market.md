<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Hydrogels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Crosslinking</li><li>Physical Crosslinking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-healing hydrogels can be categorized into two main types: chemical crosslinking and physical crosslinking. Chemical crosslinking involves the use of covalent bonds to hold the hydrogel structure together, providing a strong and permanent network. On the other hand, physical crosslinking relies on weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, allowing the hydrogel to undergo reversible changes in response to external stimuli. Each type has its own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in the market.</p></p>
